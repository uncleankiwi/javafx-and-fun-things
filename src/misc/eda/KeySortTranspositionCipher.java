/*
Given a message and a key, encrypt or decrypt it.

e.g. Key 'maple', message 'blah blah black sheep'.
Encryption steps:
1. Assign every letter of message to a letter of key.

	m a p l e
	---------
	b l a h
	b l a h
	b l a c k
	s h e e p

2. Sort the key and every corresponding message letter along with it.

	a e l m p
	---------
	l   h b a
	l   h b a
	l k c b a
	h p e s e

3. Put it back together.
