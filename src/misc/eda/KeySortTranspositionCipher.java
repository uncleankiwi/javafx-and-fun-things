/*
Given a message and a key, encrypt or decrypt it.

e.g. Key 'maple', message 'blah blah black sheep'.
Encryption steps:
1. Assign every letter of message to a letter of key.

	m a p l e
	---------
	b l a h
	b l a h
	b l a c k
	  s h e e
	p

2. Sort the key and every corresponding message letter along with it.

	a e l m p
	---------
	l   h b a
	l   h b a
	l k c b a
	s e e   h
	      p

3. Put it back together.

	l hbal hbalkcbasee h   p

For the step where we arrange the key alphabetically to get new indices,
there are a few ways of achieving this:

	1. (Simple) Use Arrays.sort, then manually match old elements to new
	while recording down the new positions. When encountering a filled index,
	it moves forward until an empty one is found.

	2. (Ok) Implement a KeyCharacter class that holds the old index and is
	also comparable, then sorting a List of these.

	3. (Overkill) Implement a KeyCharacter class... then put it into a TreeSet
	to automatically sort it.
